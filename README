=      File description     =
=============================

Checker.java - This an abstract class , the purpose of this class to check the code of the file 
, its check the method name global and local variable and if/ while line , if theres any error in 
line this class will throw an Exception 

Compiler.java - This class call the method of the Reader class and check if theres error it will print 
1 after that will print the error message and return from the programs 

Patterns.java - This an enum class its contain all the possible regex pattern can be in the code 
example it have the method regex pattern and variable 

Reader.java - This class cotain two main method , firstRead which read the file for the first time and 
check the code to array , while saving to array its check the method line ( name of the method, the 
type of arguments and theres name and the pattern of the method ) , and check the global variable
, and save them to hashMap. The second method its secondRead the purpose of this method to check 
the code inside the method if/while and local variable .

Sjavac.java - This class contain only main which start the program, its recived path from argv

tree folder :

TreeNode.java - This class implemention of tree that have vetices ( MyNode ,Scope ) 
Method.java-  This class called when we read the method line from code 
its set the method obeject ( name of the method, the variable arguments ) its set the start line of this 
method and the end line 
MyNode.java- This class describe all the vertices ( node )  in the tree, extend from TreeNode
Root.java - This class is the root of the tree , Its extend from TreeNode class ,its the first 
node in the tree
Scope.java - This class describes the scope 
Variable.java - This class describe the global and local variable
 its contain an information of the variable <name,isFinal,isInitialized,type>
 
exception folder :
MyException.java - This class contain all the error msg that can , Its throw and exception if theres 
error printings the error msg and the line of the error

=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
The Design : its based on tree that have a root which contain the hashMap of variable and 
the method object , while reading the code inside the method we open scope, and if we read
if/while we open new scope to set the new variable .

For the method and variable : theres class that make object that describes them and to information 
of them in easy way and to make the code more readable

For the Exception : Theres class MyException thats extend from Exception in java 
, this class cotain all the error msg its can be in the code and its throw an Exception

Theres checker class that check all the possibilities what can be inside the method or in global variable
, theres setError method in the the check thats set the error msg to be printed 

the checker using regex to check the patterns of line if its method or variable if/while line etc..
All the regexs in the enum class that have method to get the regexs by there name 

Compiler class its print 0 in case theres not error in the code, in case of error its catch the exception
and print the right msg of the error and exit from the program
